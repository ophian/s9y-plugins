 PLEASE NOTE

This Serendipity guestbook plugin is TEMPLATE based, configurable by its own stylesheet, has a FRONTEND and a BACKEND.
Please read the Config, Admin, Design and last modified entry Changelog Section of this file carefully.

S9Y :: GUESTBOOK :: CONFIG SETTINGS

    * The 'Permalink' setting defines a permalink for the URL. Needs the absolute HTTP path and needs to end with .htm or .html!
      The Serendipity default value is "/blogname/pages/guestbook.html", or, in case you are not using mod_rewrite, "/blogname/index.php?/pages/guestbook.html".
    * The 'Static Pagetitle & URL' setting defines the staticpage title of the page.
      Attention: this also defines the URL of the page (index.php?serendipity[subpage]=name). Just one short name without whitespaces (default: guestbook).
    * The 'Headline' setting defines the headline of the page inside your blog with your normal blog design (optional).
    * The 'Intro' setting defines additional introductory Text (optional).
    * The 'Guestbook form order' setting defines the place of your guestbook form, on top or bottom of the entries (default: top).
    * The 'Entries per page' setting defines how many entries to display per page (default: 10).
    * The 'Characters per line (Wordwrap)' setting defines after how many characters a guestbook text line will be automatically wrapped (default: 120).
    * The 'Format as article' setting defines if the output is automatically formatted as an article (colors, borders, etc.) (default: yes).
    * The 'Send e-mail to admin' setting defines email information of entries. The admin gets an e-mail for each new entry. Insert email address on next step (default: false).
    * The 'User Email' setting defines a form field for the e-mail of the user (default: yes).
    * The 'User Homepage' setting defines a form field for the homepage of the user (default: false).
    * The 'Show Captchas' setting defines the use of Serendipity CAPTCHAS (requires Spamblock plugin activated) to prevent comment SPAM (default: yes).
    * The 'Approve entries' setting defines the guestbook entries to be verified by admin generally before they show up in frontend (default: false).
    * The 'Auto-moderate' setting defines the same behaviour for a single entry, if the SPAMBLOCK-plugin wordfilter option is activ and set to 'moderate', caused by stopword matches (default: false). The guestbook content evaluation will still return captcha checking, if any spam check evaluates true. This differs from normal spamblock behaviour!
    * The 'Entry checks' setting sets an active and individual wordfilter array (default: pre-filled). Regular Expressions are allowed, separate strings by semicolons (;). You have to escape special chars with "\". If you leave this field empty, no special checks are done.
    * The 'Date format' setting defines an individual strftime() code for the entry datetime (default: %a, %d.%m.%Y %H:%M).

S9Y :: GUESTBOOK :: ADMINISTRATION

    * Backend and frontend administration is possible, if logged in. The frontend administration allows erasing entries only, but will ask you to proceed. Frontend administration got removed with 3.24 version.
    * The backend sidebar has a new link to administer the guestbook. There are 4 main points to show up:
      1.   view approved entries,
      2.   view unapproved entries (if 'Approve entries' is set to true),
      3.   edit or insert an entry,
      4.   the database section.
    * Each of the first two, have the ability to (confirm,) erase (immediately!), or re-edit a single entry.
    * The database section will allow: backup and download the plugin database table, or erase the SQL table instantly. Be careful working here!
    * A link to SQL insert is shown, but not active, since this isn't trivial enough by now.

S9Y :: GUESTBOOK :: DESIGN

    * All smarty tpls, images and the one main stylesheet of this plugin are located in the plugin folder and remain to stay there.
    * If you are skilled and wish to have an individual frontend design, copy the files to change to your template folder only
      ( plugin_guestbook_entries.tpl, plugin_guestbook_form.tpl, style_guestbook_backend.css ).
    * In case you wish to change the frontend entry background colors only, copy these neutral white css directives:
      /* styles guestbook entry colors neutral */
      /* the entry headline */ .guestbook_entrytop { background:none repeat scroll 0 0 #FFF; }
      /* the entry background color */ .guestbook_entrybottom { background:none repeat scroll 0 0 #FFF; }
      /* the admin comment line */ span.guestbook_admin_comment { background:none repeat scroll 0 0 #FFF; }
      /* the bottom shadow line */ #guestbook_entrybundle { -moz-border-radius: 0 0; background:none repeat scroll 0 0 #FFF; }
      to the end of your templates user.css file, if you have one (suggested approach!).
      If your template does not support an individual stylesheet, copy the style_guestbook_backend.css file to your template folder,
      set the directives to the end and change the #FFF to your prefered color (#FFF is neutral white).
    * If you want to purge the frontend entry borders too, add: border: 0 none; to each of them.
    * If you even wish to change all frontend entry text colors, add:
      #guestbook_entrybundle table,
      #guestbook_entrybundle table a,
      #guestbook_entrybundle .guestbook_entrytop,
      #guestbook_entrybundle .guestbook_entrybottom,
      #guestbook_entrybundle .guestbook_admin_comment p,
      #guestbook_entrybundle .guestbook_admin_comment blockquote,
      #guestbook_entrybundle .guestbook_admin_comment blockquote p,
      #guestbook_entrybundle .guestbook_admin_comment blockquote p q { color: #000; } 
      for a black text color (#000).
    * No space between frontend entry blocks? Add: .guestbook_splitentries { display: none; visibility: hidden; }
    * The Intro, if set in config, can be modified with: #guestbook_wrapper .guestbook_intro { padding: 0 none; text-align: left; border: 0 none; background:none repeat scroll 0 0 #FFF; }
    * You can find a very nice list of available web colours here http://www.wackerart.de/rgbfarben.html. Happy designing!

-------------------------------------
| Version 2.8 to 3.11 - 2007-2009   |
-------------------------------------
- some tweaks by Garvin see ChangeLog


-------------------------------------
| Version 2.8 - 2007-07-23          |
-------------------------------------

- ATTENTION: This version needs you to verify and set/submit the guestbook config again!

- Changed lang files. The lang files <en>, <de> and <de-utf8> are now up to date. 
    ***    If you update other lang files please change the first line to 
        $Id: serendipity_event_guestbook.php, langfile(short name) v2.8 200x/xx/xx name

- Images new and moved and old files clean up.
    ***    Deleted the very old 'plugin_guestbook.tpl' file: this confuses newbies. Please do the same!
    ***    button_background.png and shorttime.gif belong into plugins img folder. 
    ***    Please delete them in plugin folder to not confuse anybody. 
    ***    Added a blank.gif and a info.gif, which actually is the config help picture, into plugins img folder. 

- Changed plugin_guestbook_form.tpl. 
    ***    make use of the new smarty vars 
    ***    if set: popup and show messages
    ***    Now a user using the popup issue can view his entry after DB INSERT. 
    ***    changed action="{$plugin_guestbook_action}#entry" to action="{$commentform_action}?frontpage#feedback" inside 
           plugin_guestbook_form.tpl. This seems necessary if you use a static page as your start page. 
           Be sure to have the staticpage plugin in order before the contactform and guestbook plugin.
           Well, actually the '?frontpage' will be done in serendipity_event_guestbook.php. 
    ***    added admin stuff
    ***    modified some css

- Changed plugin_guestbook_entries.tpl. 
    ***    make use of the new smarty vars 
    ***    if set: order form on top or end and be able to even link to the form
    ***    moved some things around
    ***    added admin stuff and a missing <td></td>, which seems nessessary!
    ***    modified some css

- Changed, cleaned and modified the style_guestbook_backend.css 
    ***    you may put a very own version of both tpl and css files inside your template folder.

>> GH: TEMPORARILY DEACTIVATED
- One extra dynamic field added (dyn).
    ***    I don't think there is any need to use mgroeninger's excellent dynamic function from contactform.

- In order to make things more configurable, these vars were changed or added (see also the lang files):

    *** 'headline'      ***     staticpage headline on top of page, by Garvin (v. 2.7).
    
    *** 'intro'         ***     is used for free additional text entry on top of guestbook page.
    
    *** 'pageurl'       ***     now called permalink, while pagetitle is used as the original (1.x) pageurl and for 
                                staticpage_pagetitle, see below. (Sounds a bit messy, I know, but this is more straight!)
    
    *** 'pagetitle'     ***     is used in staticpages and other templates and defines the URL of the page 
                                'index.php?serendipity[subpage]=name'.
    
    *** 'formorder'     ***     decide to have form appear first, default is form at end of entries.
    
    *** 'formpopup'     ***     decide to have the form appear in a popup page, default (yes) is no popup.

    >>GH:TEMPORARILY DEACTIVATED!
    *** 'showdynfield'  ***     this is a basic dynamic field as a mysql varchar(100) field. 
                    Use with a input field in plugin_guestbook_form.tpl 
                    and as a text output in plugin_guestbook_entries.tpl.
                    I tried it with a tinyblob field, but it is not a very good idea 
                    to store binary data in databases, and so I came back to this small input text field.
                    If you want to change this field with another label name, set config dynfield to the new name and submit.

- Fixed a small bug in paginator function.

- General code clean up and moved things around. More documented code.

- Now this really is a fully template version (99.9% ;-)). 
    *** Moved some remaining divs and some admin stuff into the tpls.
    *** Sorry, there are still some needs inside functions for remaining line breaks and the urls of the paginator function.

- Good news! The code for the staticpage plugin at the end oft this page is obsolet by now. 
    *** We'll keep the compatibility to 1.x until next 3.x release. Well, actually this version should be 3.0.....


-------------------------------------
| Version 2.5 to 2.7 - 2007-??-??   |
-------------------------------------
- some tweaks by Garvin

Doing this, changes to code will take effect.

- Made sidebar serendipity_plugin_guestbook work with 2.0 version only

- Target admin mail address should now be compatible to old guestbook version 1.38 - just one targetmail used

- Change old guestbook table now works for mysql (only?)

- More cleanup / renaming and reconfigured wordwrap in config for 2.0 final

- Now the guestbook should work well with/without CAPTCHAS - this needed a new config variable so please check your Captchas settings in spamblock and! guestbook plugins

- Generell clean up and messages tweaks.

- Now serendipity_event_guestbook is nearly full template based (see plugin_guestbook_entries.tpl and plugin_guestbook_form.tpl)

- You will find images shorttime.gif, button_background.png and delete.png in $this_plugin/img dir now.

- Change css (style_guestbook_backend.css) and template files to your needs

- Please check other lang files - actualy only <en>, <de> and <de-utf8> will work!

- Permalink ("pageurl") is a full path from http root eg. "/serendipity/pages/guestbook.html" or "/serendipity/index.php?/pages/guestbook.html" (see mod_rewrite)

- Please Note: This version is making use of plugin::spamblock features and captchas (disabled for admins),

- Please Note: timelock and sessionlock config vars will not be used anymore - removed by table update
